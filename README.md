<strong>Part-1</strong>

Create a video application by using Node.js and Express.js.

<ol>

 <li>Your application should include all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for manipulating <em>videos. </em>As other functions are already implemented in hands-on videos, you will only need to implement edit and update for the assignment.</li>

 <li>Include search (partial search on “title”) and filtering (filter by “genre”) functions. Integrate search and filter together (if a genre is selected, search for movies under selected genre). Search and filtering should be available on home page (index.ejs). You can hardcode the list of genres for drop down list.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Part-2</strong>

Implement the search function for React application. Include one search box and search button on top of the listing page. List only the vidoes whose <em>title</em> includes the given keywords (partial search on title).

React will get complete list of videos from the API created by Node.js application which is accessible at below end point.

<a href="http://localhost:3000/api/videos">http://localhost:3000/api/videos</a>

React hands-on example shows how to get list of videos from the API.

See below two tutorials to learn how to create an interactive UI in React . You will need this feature for updating video list based on given keywords.
